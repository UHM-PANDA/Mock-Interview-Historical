# Week 5: “Sum-thing is wrong”
### October 5 – 9, 2020

#### 1) Two Sum
Given an array of integers and a key, return True if there are two values within the array that add up to the key.  Return False otherwise.
```
Input: [4, 3, 2, 6, 5], 8
Output: True

There are multiple solutions (such as 6 + 2 or 5 + 3).  Your algorithm should be able to find either of these and return True.
```
#### 2) Three Sum
Given an array of integers and a key, return True if there are three values within the array that add up to the key.  Return False otherwise.
```
Input: [4, 3, 2, 6, 5], 9
Output: True

Note: If 4 were not there, then the algorithm should return False.  You need exactly 3 integers to add up to the key.
```
#### 3) Subset Sum
Given an array of integers and a key, return True if there's any combination of integers in the array that would add up to the key.  Return False otherwise.
```
Input: [1, 5, 6, 4, 2, 3, 9], 16
Output: True

5 + 6 + 2 + 3 = 16
```
