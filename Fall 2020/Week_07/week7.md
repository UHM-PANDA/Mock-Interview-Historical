# Week 8: “SPOOKY WEEK CONTEST”
### October 26 – 30, 2020
###Total (10 points)

###Overlapping Rectangles in 2 Dimensions (1 Point)
Given coordinates to two rectangles vertices. Determine whether or not the two rectangles overlap each other. If they overlap, return true, else return false. Overlap: there exists an area > 0 that is contained within both rectangles.

###Layered Matrix Rotation (2 Points)
Given a matrix and an integer, output the matrix where each “layer” of the matrix rotated clockwise. The amount rotated is dependant on the “layer depth,” so the 0th layer is rotated k; the 1st layer is rotated k-1; the 2nd layer is rotated k-2; etc. until there exists no more layers.

###Overlapping N-Gons (2 points)
Given coordinates in clockwise order of two n-gons vertices. Determine whether or not the two n-gons overlap each other. If they overlap, return true, else return false. Overlap: there exists an area > 0 that is contained within both shapes.
Overlap: there exists an area > 0 that is contained within both rectangles.

###Overlapping N-Gons in D-Dimensions (5 points)
Given d-dimensional coordinates to two n-gons vertices. Determine whether the two shapes TOUCH.  If they TOUCH, return true, else return false.
TOUCH: they share ANY point
