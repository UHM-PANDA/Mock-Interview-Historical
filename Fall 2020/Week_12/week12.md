# Week 14: “Riddle Me This”

#### 1) Prisoner Hat Problem
```
 There are 10 prisoners and 10 hats. Each prisoner is assigned a random hat, either red or blue, but the number of each color hat is not known to the prisoners. The prisoners will be lined up single file where each can see the hats in front of him but not behind. Starting with the prisoner in the back of the line and moving forward, they must each, in turn, say only one word which must be "red" or "blue". If the word matches their hat color they are released, if not, they are killed on the spot. A sympathetic guard warns them of this test one hour beforehand and tells them that they can formulate a plan where by following the stated rules, 9 of the 10 prisoners will definitely survive, and 1 has a 50/50 chance of survival. What is the plan to achieve the goal?

#### 2) Goat-Wolf-Cabbage-Farmer Problem
```
A man has to take a wolf, a goat, and some cabbage across a river. His rowboat has enough room for the man plus either the wolf or the goat or the cabbage. If he takes the cabbage with him, the wolf will eat the goat. If he takes the wolf, the goat will eat the cabbage. Only when the man is present are the goat and the cabbage safe from their enemies. All the same, the man carries wolf, goat, and cabbage across the river. How?

#### 3) Einsteins riddle
```
The situation:
- There are 5 houses in five different colors.
- In each house lives a person with a different nationality.
- These five owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar and keep a certain pet.
- No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar or drink the same beverage.

The question is: Who owns the fish?

Hints:
- the Brit lives in the red house
- the Swede keeps dogs as pets
- the Dane drinks tea
- the green house is on the left of the white house
- the green house's owner drinks coffee
- the person who smokes Pall Mall rears birds
- the owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill
- the man living in the center house drinks milk
- the Norwegian lives in the first house
- the man who smokes blends lives next to the one who keeps cats
- the man who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill
- the owner who smokes BlueMaster drinks beer
- the German smokes Prince
- the Norwegian lives next to the blue house
- the man who smokes blend has a neighbor who drinks water
```
#### 4) The HARDEST Puzzle Yet!
```
Make all these math statments true. Add in any math operations between the three of the numbers to make them true.

0   0   0  =  6
1   1   1  =  6
2   2   2  =  6
3   3   3  =  6
4   4   4  =  6
5   5   5  =  6
6   6   6  =  6
7   7   7  =  6
8   8   8  =  6
9   9   9  =  6


freebie:
6 + 6 - 6 = 6


Catch is that you cannot do an operation that requires you to draw another number. For example, cube-root or squaring operations are not allowes as then require you to draw another number. You can only use math operations that do not require you to draw another number.
