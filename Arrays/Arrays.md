input: [1,1,2,2,3,4,5,5,6]
output: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
```
#### 2) Pascal's Triangle
Given a target height, compute Pascals Triangle to the target height. The output is a multi-dimensional array, where each sub-array represents a level in the triangle.
```
Pascals Triangle
            1
           1 1
          1 2 1
         1 3 3 1
        1 4 6 4 1

input: 4
output: [[1],[1,1],[1,2,1],[1,3,3,1]]

```
